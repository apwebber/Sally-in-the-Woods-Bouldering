Sally in the Woods hosts some 'esoteric' bouldering, but don't take that to mean that it's not worth your time! There are now dozens of problems set out on really nice quality limestone boulders and an impressive cave, host to one of the UKs hardest crack climbs. There is a range of styles here, with slabs, roofs, caves, steep stuff, pockets, crimps, and traverses, all on good quality hard limestone. More information on specific climbs available at the [UKC page](https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/crags/sally_in_the_woods-15849).
